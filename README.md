# CoCoLex: Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Grounded Legal Text Generation

**CoCoLex** is a decoding strategy for improving **faithfulness and factual accuracy** in **legal text generation**. It enhances standard large language models (LLMs) by dynamically combining model-generated outputs with context-based copying, guided by model confidence scores.

ðŸ“Œ Official implementation of our ACL 2025 paper:  
[**CoCoLex: Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Grounded Legal Text Generation**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05534)

## Key Features

- âœ… Improves **faithfulness** in legal text generation
- ðŸ“š Leverages **retrieved legal context** via copy-based decoding
- ðŸŽ¯ Uses **confidence-based interpolation** of generation and copy distributions
- ðŸ§ª Benchmarked on **five legal NLP datasets**

## Abstract

LLMs have strong potential for legal NLP but often generate unfaithful or hallucinated text. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) adds external knowledge but doesnâ€™t ensure it's used effectively. **CoCoLex** solves this by interpolating model predictions with a copy-based distribution over the retrieved context, guided by model confidence. Experiments show that CoCoLex improves groundedness and faithfulness in long-form legal generation.

## Usage Example

```python
from cocolex import CoCoLex

# Initialize CoCoLex model
model = CoCoLex(
    model_name="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3",
    device=0
)

# Define prompts
prompts = ["Given the contract details above, summarize the obligations of each party."]
# Contexts are what will be passed to the model as context - List of strings
contexts = ["This agreement is entered into by the Parties on January 1, 2025..."]

# Datastore construction parameter (will change for CoCoLex+)
references = copy.deepcopy(contexts)

# Generate tokens
outputs = model.generate(
    prompts=prompts,
    contexts=contexts,
    references=references,
    max_length=100,
)

# Decode and print the generated text
decoded_output = model.tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(decoded_output[0])
```

## ðŸ§ª Experiment environment (conda) and notebook

Follow these steps to set up a minimal environment for the experiment notebook under `experiment/` and run it.

1. Create a conda env

```bash
conda create -n cocolex-exp python=3.10 -y
conda activate cocolex-exp
```

2. Install requirements for the experiment

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r experiment/requirements.txt
```

4. Run the notebook

- Open [experiment/cocolex.ipynb](experiment/cocolex.ipynb) in VS Code or Jupyter, and select the `Python (cocolex-exp)` kernel.
- Execute the cells to reproduce the data loading and prompt construction pipeline.

Notes:

- The experiment uses public Hugging Face datasets (ylkhayat/\*-generation-workshop). Access requires internet.

### CoLex (copy-only)

```python
outputs = model.generate(
    prompts=prompts,
    contexts=contexts,
    references=references,
    max_length=100,
    lamba=0.5, # CoLex uses a fixed lambda value for copy-based distribution
)
```

### CoCoLex (confidence-guided; default)

```python
outputs = model.generate(
    prompts=prompts,
    contexts=contexts,
    references=copy.deepcopy(references),
    max_length=100,
)
```

### CoCoLex-Plus (uses chunked datastore references)

```python
# References are the datastore entries, which can be longer documents to support the full input - List of List of strings
full_contexts = [
  [
    "This agreement is entered into by the Parties on January 1, 2025. The obligations of each party are as follows: ...",
    "The contract stipulates that Party A must deliver goods by March 1, 2025, while Party B must make payment within 30 days."
  ]
]
outputs = model.generate(
    prompts=prompts,
    contexts=contexts,
    references=full_contexts,
    max_length=100,
    use_plus=True,  # Enable CoCoLex+ mode
)
```

### Ada + CoCoLex

```python
outputs = model.generate(
    prompts=prompts,
    contexts=contexts,
    references=copy.deepcopy(references),
    max_length=100,
    use_jsd=True
)
```
