# CoCoLex: Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Grounded Legal Text Generation

This is the **official implementation** of **CoCoLex**, a decoding strategy designed to improve faithfulness in legal text generation by dynamically interpolating model-generated token distributions with a copy-based distribution derived from retrieved context, guided by model confidence.

<!-- ## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Ensures greater fidelity to legal source documents.
- Balances token generation and direct copying for more accurate outputs.
- Outperforms existing context-aware decoding strategies on legal benchmarks. -->
